> JK Rowling has revealed that she will release the long-awaited e-books of her mind-bogglingly popular fantasy series through her own ecommerce store and interactive online experience, [Pottermore](http://www.pottermore.com/).
> 
> Crucially, Rowling will sell the e-books through a proprietary platform, she revealed at a press conference this morning in the Victoria & Albert museum in London. Because of a shrewd arrangement with her publishers Bloomsbury and Scholastic (or possibly just a short-sighted one on the publishers' side), Rowling retains the digital rights to the seven _Harry Potter_ novels. Bloomsbury and Scholastic still have control of print publishing rights.
