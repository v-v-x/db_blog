> The Internet is the world’s largest copy machine,” Kelly said. How do you create anything of value when it can be copied so easily? In this new ecosystem, things become valuable if they can’t be copied easily, and if they’re easy to pay for. We are willing to pay for personalization (having music tailored to the acoustics of your living room), findability (amazon is more useful than a zipped file of every piece of music ever recorded in the world), and embodiment (concerts as opposed to albums). These and other “generatives” are valuable, because they have become the new fundamental economic unit.

Это шестое слово — generating. А первые пять: screening, interacting, sharing, flowing и accessing.
