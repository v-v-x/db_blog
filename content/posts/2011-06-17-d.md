> Klebanoff, who founded New York-based digital publisher Rosetta Books in 2001, met UK-based agents last week and addressed a meeting of about 65 agents organised by the Association of Authors Agents on Monday.
> 
> Klebanoff is looking for backlist titles where digital rights are unassigned, with a view to acquiring both world rights or US rights alone. He said Rosetta was offering a royalty more than double that on offer from large print publishers—a 50% net royalty payment for up to 2,500 copies sold and then 60% after.

Rosetta Books предлагает 50% роялти до тиража 2500 экз. и 60% после превышения порога. Для авторов — очень недурно.
