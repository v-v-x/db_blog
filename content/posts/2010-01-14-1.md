> January 1st 2010 — and every January 1st –  is [public domain day](http://www.law.duke.edu/cspd/publicdomainday), the day we celebrate the entry of copyrighted works into the public domain.  In the United States [no published work will pass into the public domain tomorrow](http://www.law.duke.edu/cspd/publicdomainday) — nor the next year, nor any year until 2019.  (If you lived in Europe you might now be celebrating the release of the works of [Freud or Yeats](http://blog.okfn.org/2009/11/25/which-works-fall-into-the-public-domain-in-2010/).)  Thus, we have little to celebrate, and many [costs to mourn](http://www.law.duke.edu/cspd/publicdomainday/whyitmatters).  Its sad to look at the works that [could be entering the public domain today](http://www.law.duke.edu/cspd/publicdomainday/pre1976).
> 
> Groups [around the world](http://www.publicdomainday.org/) are using Public Domain Day as a way to explain the effects of our copyright system on our collective culture.   ([Communia’s](http://www.publicdomainday.org/) site and the [Public Domain Works](http://www.publicdomainworks.net/) registry deserve special attention.)  )   For more details about Public Domain Day  go to the Center for the Study of the Public Domain’s [Public Domain Day Website](http://www.law.duke.edu/cspd/publicdomainday), or visit our [Frequently Asked Questions](http://www.law.duke.edu/cspd/publicdomainday/pddfaq) page.  And happy Public Domain Day, and Happy New Year, to all of you.
