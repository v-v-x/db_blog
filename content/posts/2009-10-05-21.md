[FT.com / Technology - AUO to kindle rivalry with half-price e-readers](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/334bf23c-aeeb-11de-96d7-00144feabdc0.html?nclick_check=1)

> Taiwan’s AU Optronics has thrown down the gauntlet to its rivals, saying it expects to be able to halve the cost of electronic readers, popularised by Amazon’s Kindle devices, within two years.  
> The world’s third-biggest flat-panel maker has begun shipping six- to nine-inch-sized e-readers to a number of clients, according to CT Liu, a senior vice-president of consumer product displays at AUO.  
> The Taiwanese company is “in talks \[to supply e-readers\] to nearly everyone you can think of”, including China Mobile and a number of European brands, Mr Liu told the Financial Times.
