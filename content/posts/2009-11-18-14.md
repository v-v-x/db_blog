[Condé Nast Gets Wired Ready For Apple Tablet (In Case There Is One) | paidContent](http://paidcontent.org/article/419-conde-nast-gets-wired-ready-for-apple-tablet-in-case-there-is-one/)  

> Just as Condé Nast celebrates the acceptance of the special, digitized issue of GQ into Apple’s App store, the company is now hoping and praying the rumors of an Apple (NSDQ: AAPL) Tablet will come true next year. Just in case, CN is readying a digital version Wired magazine, ads and all, for the awaited Apple gadget, MediaMemo’s Peter Kafka reports. Ultimately, the plan is to create a template for all 18 of CN’s titles.

> Not that anyone should assume CN has any inside word on Apple’s plans, as the publisher’s CEO Charles Townsend says the company isn’t offering any clues. In any case, CN wants to make sure that its digitized mags can fit any of the other large touch-screen products that are definitely coming to the market. CN will rely on new software from Adobe (NSDQ: ADBE), which is working exclusively with the publisher on this. Other mag owners are expected to get the digital mag software sometime next year.
