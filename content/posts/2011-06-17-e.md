> The Japanese eBook industry is crowded and awash with activity but is making no progress. In a recent edition of the eBook Journal, Yashio Uemura of Tokyo Denki University laments that the current eBook boom in Japan is in reality a boom in eBook seminars.
> 
> This sense of frustration within the industry may seem at odds with annual revenues, as reported by Impress R&D, of $600 million and growth in excess of 20% per year. These impressive numbers belie the fact that comics make up 75% of the revenue and apart from comics and magazines there seems little significant advance in broadening the eBook customer base within Japan.
