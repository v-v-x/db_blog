[Taiwan Plans to Roll out E-readers in Schools - PC World](http://www.pcworld.com/article/183331/taiwan_plans_to_roll_out_ereaders_in_schools.html)

> Taiwan's Ministry of Education plans to offer e-readers to schoolkids on the island next year as part of efforts to further digitize schools and promote reading. The e-readers are part of a five-year, NT$50 billion (US$1.55 billion) budget earmarked for information technology in classrooms. Currently the ministry is reviewing designs for e-readers and doesn't yet know how many it will purchase for next year, a representative said. The only e-reader displayed at the Ministry of Education's booth at the IT Month exhibition in Taipei on Monday was a color e-reader designed by Aiptek International for young children. The [Aiptek inColor](http://tw.ebookincolor.com/) e-reader has an 8-inch color screen and 1GB of flash memory for storage. It comes with 20 multimedia e-books pre-installed and costs NT$6,900 (US$213) in Taiwan, according to Hsu Fang-chi, a media representative at Aiptek.
