> Google's executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, warned on Wednesday that government plans to block access to illicit [filesharing](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/file-sharing "More from guardian.co.uk on Filesharing") websites could set a "disastrous precedent" for freedom of speech.
> 
> Speaking to journalists after his keynote speech at Google's Big Tent conference in London, Schmidt said the online search giant would challenge [attempts to restrict access to the Pirate Bay and other so-called "cyberlocker" sites](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/mar/22/isps-urged-to-block-filesharing-sites "attempts to restrict access to the Pirate Bay and other so-called cyberlocker sites") that encourage illegal downloading – part of government plans to fight online [piracy](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/piracy "More from guardian.co.uk on Piracy") through controversial measures included in the Digital Economy Act.

> "If there is a law that requires DNSs \[domain name systems, the protocol that allows users to connect to websites\] to do X and it's passed by both houses of congress and signed by the president of the United States and we disagree with it then we would still fight it," he added. "If it's a request the answer is we wouldn't do it, if it's a discussion we wouldn't do it."
