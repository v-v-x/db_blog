> Today, Creative Commons [announces](http://creativecommons.org/press-releases/entry/23755) the release of its [Public Domain Mark](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/), a tool that enables works free of known copyright restrictions to be labeled in a way that allows them to be easily discovered over the Internet. The Public Domain Mark, to be used for marking works already free of copyright, complements Creative Commons’ [CC0 public domain dedication](http://creativecommons.org/about/cc0), which enables authors to relinquish their rights prior to the expiration of copyright.
