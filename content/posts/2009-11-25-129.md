> According to a leaked report obtained by Crain's NY, digital book sales at the company have increased dramatically. Despite impressive growth, the company called it "an incubatory period" for the digital book industry--a fraction of the company's overall revenues.  
>   
> Here's more from the article: "sales of its Kindle e-books through September 2009 came to $22.6 million, an increase of almost 700% over the $2.9 million in revenue that the Kindle generated during the same period in 2008. The Lost Symbol was a big part of that growth. Published Sept. 15, the thriller sold 100,000 e-books its first week out, or about 5% of total sales for the book. In the first half of 2009, Random House e-book revenue grew by 400%, says a spokesman."
