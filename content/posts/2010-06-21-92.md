> Both Amazon and Barnes & Noble dropped the prices of their dedicated e-book readers Monday, no doubt to compete with the likes of the iPad. Amazon now offers its 3G-enabled Kindle 2 for $189, while Barnes & Noble's 3G-enabled nook is now $199—both were previously priced at $259. Additionally, Barnes & Noble has introduced a WiFi-only Nook that will retail for $149.
