[The Kindle Reader: The Kindle Explores DASH (Digital Access to Scholarship at Harvard)](http://kindlereader.blogspot.com/2009/09/kindle-explores-dash-digital-access-to.html)

> On September 8th, Harvard launched DASH (Digital Access to Scholarship at Harvard) - an open access repository of scholarly works in **PDF** format. Still in beta, the site contains more than 1500 articles by Harvard-affiliated authors, divided into two "communities" - the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and the Harvard Law School.
