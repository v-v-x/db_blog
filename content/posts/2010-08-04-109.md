> Lonely Planet has launched augmented reality guides for UK's Google Android users.
> 
> Its 'Compass Guides' are available for 25 locations including Amsterdam, Bangkok, Barcelona, Hong Kong, Istanbul, London, Paris, Prague and New York City. They are available for $4.99 (£3.12) from the Google Android store.
> 
> Matthew Cashmore, innovation and ecosystems manager, said: "This is one of the most innovative things we’ve launched and we’re really excited to see how people use this application."
> 
> He added: "The application pinpoints your exact location so that when you find yourself in a new city and want to know what there is to see and do around you, just look through the camera and a wealth of Lonely Planet information on the best destinations, accommodation, sites, bars and restaurants appear stuck like posted notes to points of interest around you."
> 
> Key features of the guides include GPS-enabled maps and location based information for hundreds of points of interest. The phone’s built in compass allows users to see their current location and how near they are to destinations and sites. The guides also are able to be used offline (with the exception of the maps), so as to avoid roaming charges.
> 
> The applications are available for English speakers and have a phrase-book feature for translating commonly used phrases containing more than 600 spoken and phonetic pronunciations.
