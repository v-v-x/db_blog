> Specifically, today's exemptions include the following:
> 
> *   Permission for cell phone owners to break access controls on their phones in order to switch wireless carriers or "jailbreak" their device
> *   Permission to break technical protections on video games to investigate or correct security flaws
> *   Permission for college professors, film students and documentary filmmakers to break copy-protection measures on DVDs so they can embed clips for educational purposes, criticism, commentary and noncommercial videos
> *   Permission to enable an e-book's read-aloud function or use a screen reader with the e-book, even when built-in access controls prevent this
> *   Permission for computer owners to bypass the need for external security devices called dongles if the dongle no longer works and cannot be replaced

Даже если вам запретили "слушать" книги - ломайте защиту.  
Приятно, когда здравый смысл побеждает.
