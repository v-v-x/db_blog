> Sixteen months after stepping down as president and chief executive of HarperCollins Publishers Worldwide, **Jane Friedman** has formed a new company that will republish old titles by big-name authors including William Styron, Iris Murdoch and Pat Conroy in electronic form.  
> Together with Jeffrey Sharp, a film producer of features including “Boys Don’t Cry” and “You Can Count on Me,” Ms. Friedman, 64, has founded **Open Road Integrated Media** to focus almost exclusively on digital publishing. The company will also seek new authors willing to be published in the electronic format first.
