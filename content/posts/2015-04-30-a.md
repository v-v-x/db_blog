> You can now create HTML5 fixed layout eBooks without any additional software or costs. The fixed layout eBook format (ePub3 or Amazon’s KF8), displays pixel-perfect layouts such as science reports or colorful animated kids books without the complexity and cost of creating and maintaining native apps. Unlike many fixed layout creation tools, your layouts need not be static either. You can add interactive enrichments such as scrollable areas, page flips, animations and more.
