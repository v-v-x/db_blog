> EPUB 3 is the newest revision of the EPUB standard. EPUB 3 is being developed pursuant to a [charter](http://idpf.org/epub/30#) approved by the IDPF Membership in May, 2010. On February 15, 2011, the IDPF published the first Public Draft of the EPUB 3 specifications.
> 
> EPUB 3 is defined by a set of individual specifications. The best starting point for learning about EPUB 3, including the roadmap to the specification documents, is the [EPUB 3 Overview](http://idpf.org/epub/30/spec/epub30-overview.html) . An index to all the specification and schema files is [here](http://idpf.org/epub/30/index.html). The complete specification set can be downloaded as a ZIP archive [here](http://idpf.org/epub/30/epub30-20110215.zip). 
> 
> The EPUB specification is developed by the IDPF EPUB Working Group, consisting of IDPF member representatives and Invited Experts. All Working Group activities are conducted in an "open source" manner: the EPUB 3 Working Group [project site](http://code.google.com/p/epub-revision) is publicly accessible and contains a source code repository for specification and related work products and a Wiki for requirements, solutions, meeting notes, etc.
> 
> All comments on EPUB 3 specifications should be submitted via the EPUB 3 Working Group [Issue Tracker](http://code.google.com/p/epub-revision/issues/list), hosted on Google Code. NOTE: you must login via a Google Account in order to submit an issue. Please submit spec comments with the label "Type-ReviewComment" and additional label(s) as appropriate for the particular issue, e.g. "Spec-Publications".
