> Worldwide media tablet shipments rose by 88.9% on a sequential basis and 303.8% year over year in the second calendar quarter of 2011 (2Q11) to 13.6 million units, according to the International Data Corporation ([IDC](http://www.idc.com/)) [Worldwide Quarterly Media Tablet and eReader Tracker](http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=IDC_P21526).

Про букридеры: «Turning to eReaders, the second quarter experienced a seasonal dip, down 9% sequentially to 5.4 million units, while year-over-year growth was 167%. Amazon led the market with a 51.7% share, followed by Barnes & Noble with 21.2%. With product refreshes and following strong 2Q11 sales, IDC expects eReader shipments to grow significantly through the holiday season, reaching a total of 27.0 million units for the year, up from a previous projection of 16.2 million units.»

Прогноз про планшетники мировой, а про букридеры — непонятно какой. Что-то я сомневаюсь, что у Kindle больше половины мирового рынка.
