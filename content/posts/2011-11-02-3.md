> Forty-one and a half percent of nurses own eReaders, and 31.4% of nurses have purchased medical related digital texts. This is according to a new survey from Springer Publishing Company. The study — which interviewed nurses, the majority of whom are nurse educators holding advanced nursing degrees — found that the Kindle is more common among this group that the Nook, as 61.4% of nurses have a Kindle versus 16.8% of them who own a Nook.
