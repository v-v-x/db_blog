> Although I’m as excited as the next guy by the coming Apple Tablet, I really don’t think it will change the world for ebooks. It’s too big, too heavy, too expensive, and likely to be too consumptive of battery power to be a better ereader for most people than a Kindle, a Sony Reader, an iPhone, or one of the many other devices announced last week at CES. My own hunch is that the Tablet won’t be as powerful a catalyst for ebooks as the Kindle was or the iPhone has been. (That’s okay: [year-on-year ebook sales are up 300% through November](http://www.ereads.com/2010/01/november-09-e-book-sales-triple-over-09.html) so they don’t actually need a lot of extra impetus…)

> But Apple’s entry into the market, if it was the tool to get this Agency model off the ground, might have a very profound effect on the ebook world going into the future. I wonder if this is the last big disruption before Google Editions. And I the next thing to ponder, although we have a bit of time, if this will in any way disrupt _that_.

Дело, считает Шатцкин, не в ней, а в агентской схеме продаж, которую предлагает Apple издателям.
