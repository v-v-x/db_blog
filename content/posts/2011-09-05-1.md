> [Reader Store](http://ebookstore.sony.com/ "Reader Store") first rolled out in North America back in 2006 and in Sony’s native Japan in 2010.
> 
> Now a UK launch is planned for October 2011, with Germany and Austria planned by year’s end and France, Italy and Spain early in 2012. Further new markets are also on the cards.
> 
> The launch dovetails with the WiFi-enabled new [Reader](http://www.gizmag.com/sony-reader-wifi-touch-screen/19717/ "Reader") e-reader Sony announced at IFA in Berlin, which has a touch-screen and pinch-zoom text resizing and is lighter than Kindle. And Reader Store will also be accessible on Sony’s new tablet devices, which have underwhelmed observers.
> 
> The UK store will have over 100,000 titles; newspapers including The Daily Mail (LSE: DMGT), The Guardian and The Observer and magazines including The New Statesman and The Spectator.
