> _Sendak_:  I hate them. It’s like making believe there’s another kind of sex. There isn’t another kind of sex. There isn’t another kind of books. A book is a book is a book. I know there’s terribly old-fashioned. I’m old, and when I’m gone they’ll probably try to make my books on all these things, but I’m going to fight it like hell.’

> _Believer_: Is the problem with e-books partly a problem of color?
> 
> _Sendak_:  Yes. Picture books depend on color, largely. And they haven’t perfected the color in those machines. But it’s not that. It’s giving up a form that is so beautiful. A book is really like a lover. It arranges itself in your life in a way that is beautiful. Even as a kid, my sister, who was the eldest, brought books home for me, and I think I spent more time sniffing and touching them than reading. I just remember the joy of the book; the beauty of the binding. The smelling of the interior. Happy.
