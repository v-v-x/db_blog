> John Locke has become the first self-published author to sell more than one million e-books through Amazon.
> 
> The author used Amazon's Kindle Direct Publishing platform to publish and sell his titles. He joins Stieg Larsson, James Patterson, Nora Roberts, Charlaine Harris, Lee Child, Suzanne Collins and Michael Connelly in what Amazon dub the Kindle Million Club.
> 
> Locke said: "Kindle Direct Publishing has provided an opportunity for independent authors to compete on a level playing field with the giants of the book selling industry. Not only did KDP give me a chance, they helped at every turn. Quite simply, KDP is the greatest friend an author can have."
> 
> Russ Grandinetti, vice-president of Kindle Content, said: "It's so exciting that self-publishing has allowed John Locke to achieve a milestone like this."
> 
> Locke, from Louisville in Kentucky, has written nine novels including _Vegas Moon_, _Wish List_, _A Girl Like You_, _Follow the Stone_, _Don't Poke the Bear!_ and the New York Times bestselling e-book, _Saving Rachel_. His latest book is called _How I Sold 1 Million e-books in 5 Months_.
