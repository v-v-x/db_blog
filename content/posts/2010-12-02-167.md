> So, for many delegates if there was one presentation that really stood out at FutureBook 2010 it was when Max Whitby, founder and CEO of [Touch Press](http://www.touchpress.com/), spoke about [_The Elements iPad app_](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-elements-a-visual-exploration/id364147847?mt=8). Not only was the project a unique idea (at the time) with an amusing story attached to it (after all — publishers and booksellers like stories), he revealed Touch Press have so far sold over 150,000 units at $14 each — with Touch Press receiving a 70% share of those sales. For the creators of _The Elements_ this translates into nearly $1.5 million in revenue. Rarely do we get to hear about iPad app sales for book apps — publishers are apparently unable to share sales figures because of restrictions from Apple –- and these heartening figures had everyone sitting upright in their seats.
