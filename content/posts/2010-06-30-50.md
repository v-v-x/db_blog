The post was Joe’s idea, but I contributed enough to its completion to justify a claim of shared authorship. Joe has kindly agreed to allow this received wisdom to be delivered to the world through The Shatzkin Files._

> As thunder roared above the mountaintop, God sat on a throne of light. She stroked her braid and contemplated her new shoes.
> 
> “Who goes there?” God shouted.
> 
> “It is but a poor publisher,” the tiny figure said.  “I have come for guidance in the treacherous ways of publishing in the digital age.  I have oodles of Googles, but no money in my pocket.  What dost thou command?”
> 
> “A poor publisher, eh?” God snorted, shaking the trees around them.  “That’s what the angels call a redundancy.”
> 
> “Oh, please, Lord.  Help me navigate the shoals of the noble Barnes and the forest where dwell the Amazons.  Take me beyond my borders to a realm of growth and economic success.  My very soul depends on my making buckets of money.”
> 
> God looked at the puny publisher and took pity on him.
> 
> “Do as I say,” God thundered, “and you will save your heavenly soul and a place for yourself in the value chain.”  She thus proceeded to lay down these precepts–but as God is timeless, they came in no particular order.
> 
> 1\. Thou shalt regard thy former competitor as thy future collaborator.
> 
> 2\. Thou shalt let no intermediary stop you from knowing your customer, nor stop your customer from knowing you.
> 
> 3\. Thou shalt publish no book intended for an audience outside your spheres of direct influence.
> 
> 4\. Thou shalt read Dr. Faustus in all its editions–Amazon, Barnes & Noble, Apple, and Google–and know that Mephistopheles always appears first as a helpmate.
> 
> 5\. Thou shalt not forsake thine own brand.
> 
> 6\. Thou shalt create new brands and master the power and importance of brands.
> 
> 7\. Thou shalt respect and value thy communities with the same devotion thou hath always given to copyrights.
> 
> 8\. Thou shalt recognize that metadata is everywhere and associating it meaningfully is thy job.
> 
> 9\. Thou shalt not fail to test a new marketing channel in order to protect an old one.
> 
> 10\. Thou shalt deliver thy content in every imaginable form that thy customers request or might require.
