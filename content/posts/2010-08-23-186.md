> _New York Times_ bestselling author and marketing guru, [Seth Godin](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/) vows to never publish traditionally again. After over [12 books](http://sethgodin.com/sg/books.asp) with a legacy publisher, Godin says he's had enough.
> 
> In my interview with him today for an upcoming [Mediabistro feature](http://www.mediabistro.com/content/archives/interviews.asp), Godin says, "I've decided not to publish any more books in the traditional way. 12 for 12 and I'm done. I like the people, but I can't abide the long wait, the filters, the big push at launch, the nudging to get people to go to a store they don't usually visit to buy something they don't usually buy, to get them to pay for an idea in a form that's hard to spread ... I really don't think the process is worth the effort that it now takes to make it work. I can reach 10 or 50 times as many people electronically. No, it's not 'better', but it's different. So while I'm not sure what format my writing will take, I'm not planning on it being the 1907 version of hardcover publishing any longer."

Логично. Тем более такие книги, как у него. Книги-идеи.
