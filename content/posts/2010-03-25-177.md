> A report from _The New York Times_ notes that a number of large corporations, including Coca-Cola, FedEx, Unilever, Toyota, Capital One, Oracle, and GM have [already bought up advertising](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/25/business/media/25ipad.html "The New York Times: Advertisers Show Interest in iPad") from the likes of _Newsweek_, _Reuters_, _Time_, _Wall Street Journal_, and _NYT_ itself. In fact, Chase has bought out all of the _NYT_ advertising units for two full months following the iPad's introduction to advertise its high-end Chase Sapphire credit card.
> 
> "There is an appetite to be associated with the inevitable buzz—the buzz around the iPad has been so long-lived,"Alisa Bowen, senior vice president and head of consumer publishing at Thomson Reuters, told _NYT_.
> 
> The deals will bring in plenty of money for those publishers, at least in the short term. Ads are running anywhere from $75,000 to $300,000, with higher prices buying exclusivity. FedEx, for instance, has three-month deals to be the exclusive advertiser for Reuters' and _Newsweek_'s iPad apps.  [_Time_ is charging $200,000 for a single spot](http://www.mobile-tech-today.com/story.xhtml?story_id=72390 "Mobile Tech today: Advertisers Snap Up iPad Spots in Popular Publications") in its first eight issues designed for the iPad. And _WSJ_ has four-month deals with several companies that cost $400,000.
