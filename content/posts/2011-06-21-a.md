> “We now sell three times as many digital books as all formats of physical books combined on BN.com,” Lynch reported. (Amazon ([NSDQ: AMZN](http://finance.paidcontent.org/paidcontent?Page=QUOTE&Ticker=AMZN "AMZN")) is [also selling](http://paidcontent.org/article/419-amazon-now-selling-more-kindle-books-than-all-print-books/ "also selling") more e-books than print books, but neither company has released actual sales numbers.) He also said that “PubIt!, our self-publishing digital platform, is the fastest growing part of our digital catalog in units and volume sales. We had our first PubIt! title reach #1 sales rank on our Nook Bookstore recently.”
