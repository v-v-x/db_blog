> Mamut said there was “a massive amount of work to be done” following his acquisition of the chain. He said: “If we can make a turnaround, improve everything, have good books properly displayed, a good atmosphere, good recommendations \[with\] marketing and investment of course, then I think we can compete with a company named Amazon.com. I can’t imagine that life can be replaced with a computer universe. I can’t accept it.”
> 
> Throughout the interview, Mamut emphasised the “emotional” attachment he had to bricks-and-mortar bookselling. He said that side of the industry has “absolutely different targets” to the digital companies that have brought technological innovations such as e-books in recent years.
> 
> He said: “We want copyright on authors to be kept carefully, we want authors to be paid \[an\] advance and royalties, and we want book stores full of people and we want reading—it may be old-fashioned, but nobody has proved that the old way of reading, publishing and selling books is something inefficient.”
> 
> Mamut said physical book stores are critical in breeding a new generation of “passionate, active, cultural, well-educated people”. He said:”I think that writing texts, publishing texts, selling texts in a physical book store is one of the important tools for breeding this new generation.

> “So, for me, buying Waterstone’s is important. It’s important for the UK, which is a country I love, which has given me a lot . . . Waterstone’s is the last significant player in the UK, and its existence is important for UK society.”
> 
> He said Waterstone’s managing director James Daunt’s love of bookshops appealed to him when he was looking for someone to run the business. He said: “I like the way he is doing business, there is a lot of respect for customers, which I appreciate. I got that feeling immediately. He tries to treat them in a very comfortable, very delicate, very informative way—and they repay him by browsing in his stores and buying books.”

Забавное интервью. Вкратце: добавим эмоции старым полкам с книгами, будем хорошо любить покупателя, и он будет покупать бумажные книги, потому что бумажные книги — это важно для культуры и образования.

Как будто цифра потихоньку ест бумагу только потому, что издатели и книготорговцы до последнего времени были грубыми циничными рвачами.

Ну, удачи.
