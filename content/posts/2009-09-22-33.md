[New Dan Brown novel tops 2 million mark - Yahoo! Finance](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/New-Dan-Brown-novel-tops-2-apf-2025745368.html?x=0&.v=1)

> Doubleday announced Tuesday that hardcover, audio and e-book sales for "The Lost Symbol" topped 2 million copies for its first week of release in the United States, Britain and Canada. The total is "well over" 2 million for English-language editions worldwide, according to Doubleday spokeswoman Suzanne Herz, who declined to offer a specific number. Herz did say that around 5 percent, or 100,000 copies, of "The Lost Symbol" were sold as e-books. Doubleday released the digital edition at the same time as the hardcover despite industry worries that e-sales might take away business from the more expensive paper text.

Один из выводов — совокупные продажи Amazon не превышают 10% от всех продаж.
