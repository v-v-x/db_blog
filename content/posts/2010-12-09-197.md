> On Thursday, the Toronto-based e-publishing startup will launch Reading Life, a new e-reading iPad application that integrates with the company's digital bookstore designed to bring social-networking capabilities to the world of electronic books, in a sort of Book Club 2.0.
> 
> Through the opt-in service, Kobo users will be able to directly share with their friends what books they're reading and share favourite passages through Facebook, keep tabs on their reading history through a comprehensive statistics tracker and earn badges and rewards for reading in a manner reminiscent of social check in services like Foursquare and Gowalla.
