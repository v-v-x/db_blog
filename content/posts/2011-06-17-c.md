> Speaking at the inaugural Futurebook Innovation Workshop, held in London Bridge, digital editor Dan Franklin announced that five 10,000 word e-books would be released on 28th July, priced £2.99, with Franklin saying the books, and the imprint, will be aiming to fill the space for long-form journalism left as traditional media contracts.
> 
> The specially-commissioned titles, all written by journalists, will be: _Kettled Youth_ by Dan Hancox; _The Debt Delusion_ by Mehdi Hassan; _The Revolution Road_ by Peter Beaumont; _Digital Activism or Slack-tivism?_ by Tom Chatfield, and Nariman Youssef's _Tahrir: 18 Days of Grace_. Speaking to _The Bookseller_, Franklin said: "The books all look at key themes behind revolution and unrest in genreal but all focus in on a specific area. All the authors have a strong online presence and a parent media organisation that they can market through, and we will be backing that too."
