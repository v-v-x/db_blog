> Thanks to strong iMac sales, Steve Jobs is insanely great again, and accolades in the trades have called Apple's reversal of fortune everything from a "rebound" to "the Second Coming." The next iMac attack promises new lollipop laptops, a more serious series of professional machines, and a wireless handheld dubbed the iPad. Though it's hard to argue with five straight profitable quarters, Apple's teal-colored turnaround is saddled to a single product line - built on an aging operating system.
