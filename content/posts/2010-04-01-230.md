> The [first application](http://www.touchpress.com/) to make use of Wolfram Alpha for e-books is the visually stunning iPad version of [Theodore Gray](http://theodoregray.com/)'s best-selling _The Elements: A Visual Exploration of Every Known Atom in the Universe_. The e-book application integrates Wolfram's computational knowledge engine closely into the e-book experience. It's easy to imagine calculus, engineering or geography textbooks that will also make use of Wolfram Alpha's vast data repository and its ability to manipulate this data. For now, the company is remaining relatively quiet about the exact details of the program, however. The full launch is scheduled to happen later in Q2 2010.
