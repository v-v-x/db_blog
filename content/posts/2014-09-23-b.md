Проще говоря — авторы книг, синопсисы которых наберут наибольшее количество голосов читателей, получат предложение от Amazon подписать контракт с небольшим ($1500) авансом и 50% роялти на электронные и звуковые права (права на печать остаются за автором) на 5 лет. Недорогой способ получить качественные рекомендации для небольших инвестиций.
