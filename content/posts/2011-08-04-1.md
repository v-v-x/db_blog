> The agreement for Google to scan out-of-print French language books for Hachette Livre has been signed, two months later than scheduled.
> 
> The five-year agreement should have been finalised six months after the memorandum of understanding was signed last November, but it was delayed until last week by technical hitches.
> 
> The pact confirms Hachette Livre will decide which titles should be scanned and which should be made available as e-books through Google and booksellers or for other commercial purposes, such as print-on-demand, the two companies said in a joint statement.
> 
> The scanned books, which potentially could total between 40,000 and 50,000, will also be entered into the database of the French National Library (BNF).
