> Redmayne said Pottermore sold over £1 million worth of e-books, about $1.59 million at £0.63 pounds to the dollar.  
> In dollars, the Harry Potter e-books are [priced](http://paidcontent.org/2012/03/27/419-you-can-buy-the-harry-potter-e-books-now/) at $7.99 each (for the first three) or $9.99 each (for the final four books in the series). Assuming an average price of $9.13, that means around 164,000 copies were sold in the first three days.

...полтора миллиона долларов за 3 дня. Около 164 тыс экземпляров. Недурно.
