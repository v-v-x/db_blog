[AFP: HP partners with university to print digital books](http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5g2Yr7R4Iye4gueYkVu6kBk-cTcDg)

> The US computer giant announced Wednesday it has teamed with the University of Michigan to offer print versions of more than 500,000 out-of-copyright books in the school's library. The books will be available for purchase through online retail giant Amazon and other outlets including HP's own [BookPrep.com](http://BookPrep.com), which already offers public domain volumes for print on-demand and purchase.

Судя по всему, этот союз решил войти на тот же рынок, что и Google с On Demand Books.
