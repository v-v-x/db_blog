But the company's new gadget—first seen here—should address the weaknesses of all other readers with screens evoking a Kindle and an iPhone. A source from within reveals the first photos and details. The Barnes and Nobles e-reader project, set to be revealed next week, has been under development for years, with several devices of varying size and capability in the pipeline. First rumors said it would have a color e-ink screen. Then people said it didn't. They were both kind of right: The layout will feature a black and white e-ink screen like the Kindle has—and a multitouch display like an iPhone underneath other. Pow!

Слишком похоже на полет фантазии дизайнера. Но, возможно, и правда. Соединение двух дисплеев - черно-белого eink и цветного сенсорного LCD - было бы интересным решением.
