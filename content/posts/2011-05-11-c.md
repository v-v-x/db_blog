> WebKit [now supports](http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/85257 "Add support for -epub-prefixed properties") the \-epub- CSS property-prefix as an alias, similar to its support for the \-apple- and \-khtml- prefixes. This addition was made following [a conference call](http://groups.google.com/group/epub-working-group/browse_thread/thread/654782de647ee7d7 "CSS Prefixes con-call results") in the EPUB Working Group last Thursday, and while [not](http://twitter.com/#!/hober/status/64014556854366208 ""@beverloo the disagreement is mostly around author conformance of unprefixed & prefixed content and not on what RSs need to support. Mostly."") [all issues](http://groups.google.com/group/epub-working-group/msg/ca976a3264b03baa ""In the teleconf, I opposed to the original proposal from Apple,which uses both unprefixed properties and fixed properties.Let me explain why."") have been resolved yet, it’s likely that they’re here to stay. One thing which is surprising is the fact that all vendors will use the same prefix: \-epub-, contrary to CSS’ vendor prefixes.
