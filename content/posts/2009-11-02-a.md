[Marvell Syncs With E Ink On New E-Reader Tech Aimed At Mass Market | paidContent](http://paidcontent.org/article/419-marvell-syncs-with-e-ink-on-new-e-reader-tech-aimed-at-mass-market/#)  

> The e-reader market is beginning to resemble a crowded subway train at rush hour and the latest entry could make it feel even more crowded. Marvell Technology Group and E Ink are partnering on a “turnkey” tech solution based on one integrated chip called the Marvell Armada 166E, with the first devices due in 2010. The chip is designed to render high-res PDFs “ultra fast,” save power, extend battery life and support ePaper in thin formats. For access, it includes 3G, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. Through an agreement with FirstPaper, the companies say the Armada also should be able to handle a variety of screen sizes, including larger formats that can handle magazine and newspaper-like layouts and graphics.
