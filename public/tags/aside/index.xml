      <description>The future of the book is inherently linked to the browser. Discussion of EPUB as a technology somehow ‘separate’ from browsers is not helping us see that very rich and quite unbelievable future, one that is entirely different to what is in front of us now. If we see EPUB as something other than a subset browser functionality we are not seeing the present or the future clearly.I’m not sure what is holding us back from this way of seeing things.</description>
